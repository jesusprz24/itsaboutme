            <h3>Eletrician</h3>
            <p>Delaney's Electric | Electrical Apprentice | August 2021 - February 2022</p>
    
            <p>While being an Eletrician for some time was enjoyable and helped to 
               teach me a lot. It wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
               The ideal job for me was something that allowed me to be creative, love
               life and not make me sick of doing it everyday.
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Roughing in houses</li>
                    <li>Pulling wire and making up receptical outlets, lights and fixtures</li>
                    <li>Trimming houses, installing outlets, and wiring</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Maintenance</h3>
            <p>Comfort Inn and Suites | Handyman/Maintenance | April 2022 - Present</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Patching drywall, painting walls, using ink markers on wood</li>
                    <li>Fixing clogged or backed up plumbing</li>
                    <li>Electrical, swapping outlets, fixing lights</li>
                    <li>Pool maintenance</li>
                </ul>
            <p>While this was an easy job it was also the point in my life where I asked myself
                what I was doing with my life. I had jumped from job to job and saw my life going
                down the drain. I knew it was time for change.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It was during this point that I decided to make a change and pursue a new career
                and this time I was not going to give up.
