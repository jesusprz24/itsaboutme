                  <p class="title">Customer service</p>
                  <p>During high school I got a very interesting job at Murdoch's 
                    Ranch and Home Supplt in Greeley, CO. I stayed there for about 
                    2 years, along the way I learned about treating people with 
                    respect, learning proper customer service, and making some good 
                    friends along the way.

                  <p class="title">Electrical Apprentice</p>
                  <p>After community college I decided to try some blue collar jobs
                    one of the most intriguing jobs was Electrician. I'm not going 
                    to lie but the thing that attracted me was the high pay. I did
                    learn a lot and made some great connections.
                    While it was a good job I did not see this being my career.

                  <h2>Warehouse Supply Inc</h2>
                  <p class="title">Maintenance</p>
                  <p>Working at Warehouse Supply Inc has been a bit of an experience. This job is only temporary until I graduate from
                    the coding bootcamp. But till then I don't mind spending my time here are Warehouse Supply Inc, there are friendly people (for the most part),
                    my boss is one of the few that actually rewards you for doing your job. Here I am in charge of inventory and reorganizing the 
                    store.
