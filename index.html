        <h3>University Schools</h3>

        <h3>Aims Community College</h3>
        <p>Aims was a very good school for me it had wonderful resources and I met a lot of great
            people. My original plan was to get my core classes out of the way and then transtion
            to a four year college afterwards. Eventually this plan fell through but I was happy to
            have graduated with my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts in May 2022.
