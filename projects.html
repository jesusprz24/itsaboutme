            <p class="desc">This project is called "Whatacrypto" it was created with the help of my fellow classmates during one
                of our project weeks. The basic premise of the game is to teach people how to use cryptocurrency. 
                The users job is to make decisions on how and when to buy and sell crypto. Using real time data you have
                the opportunity to see if you make a nice profit or if you lose it all.

            <p class="desc">Baconator is a Kevin Bacon inspired project where users can comment of Kevin Bacon movies. 
               This project uses all the concepts of Full Stack Development from front end to backend. As much as 
               I enjoyed this project one of the most challenging things about this was working with the backend languages.
               I excel in the front end, while the backend has been one of the most challenging things for me to grasp.
